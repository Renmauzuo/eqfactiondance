  <p>This list includes factions which you can begin working on now as you shouldn't need to hurt them later when increasing other factions. When you have maxed a faction (or if you want to skip it) click the button next to name to update the list.</p>
  <p>Completed factions are saved using localStorage.</p>
  <div id="safe-factions">

  </div>
  <p>This list includes factions that are not yet safe as you are likely to hurt them while increasing factions in the list above. While you can still work on improving your standing you may end up undoing some of your work. This list is provided so that you can pre-emptively skip some factions listed here, which might expand the list of safe factions above.</p>
  <p>Note that some factions are diametrically opposed to each such as the Dragons of Norrath mission factions. It is impossible to raise one without harming the other and so these factions will never appear in the list above unless you skip their enemies in the list below.</p>
