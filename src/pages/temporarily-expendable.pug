    h1 Temporarily Expendable Factions
    p I originally made this script for my own use when making this guide but decided to leave it here in case it's of interest to anyone else. The list contains factions that can be raised without hurting other factions, or only hurting expendable factions or other factions already on this list. The script recurisvely adds more factions to the list until no more factions satisfy the conditions to be added.
    p In practical terms that means any of these factions can be damaged while working to improve other factions as you always have a linear route to repair them, even if it involves a few steps. They are what I call "temporarily expendable." This list (and the one below it) will update based on your era and importance preferences, but not completed factions.
    #temporarily-expendable
    p Obviously, not all factions qualify for the above list. The following factions are factions which do not qualify for the above list, either because they can't be raised, are diametrically opposed to one or more other factions, or can only be raised by hurting another faction which is not expendable.
    #not-expendable
