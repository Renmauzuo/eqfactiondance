While you can still work on improving your standing you may end up undoing some of your work. This list is provided so that you can pre-emptively skip some factions listed here, which might expand the list of safe factions above.</p><p>Note that some factions are diametrically opposed to each such as the Dragons of Norrath mission factions. It is impossible to raise one without harming the other and so these factions will never appear in the list above unless you skip their enemies in the list below.</p><div id="unsafe-factions"></div><footer><p><a href="https://github.com/Renmauzuo/eqfactiondance">Fork me</a></p></footer></main><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="scripts/data.min.js"></script><script src="scripts/global.min.js"></script><script src="scripts/factionOrder.min.js"></script></body></html>
