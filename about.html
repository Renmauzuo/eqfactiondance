  	<h1>About EQ Faction Dance</h1>
  	<p>This site is meant to be a tool to assist adventurers who want to ally with as many factions as possible.</p>
  	<p>This is an open source project. If you find an error or have an idea for a change feel free to either open an issue <a href="https://github.com/Renmauzuo/eqfactiondance/issues">on Github</a> or fork the repository and make a pull request with your desired changes.</p>
  	<p><strong>Faction List</strong></p>
  	<p>The faction list page provides a list of faction links. Clicking a faction will show a quick summary of how to raise that faction and what factions are likely to be hurt by raising it. You can then click on those to see how to repair those factions when you've maxed the original one.</p>
  	<p><strong>Faction List</strong></p>
  	<p>The faction order page calculates the optimal order to increase factions in. It will first show you a list of factions that you won't need to hurt later. Once you've maxed a faction (or simply want to skip it) you can mark it complete. At that point any factions you had to hurt to raise the previous faction but can now be safely raised will be added to the list.</p>
  	<p>For example, if your goal is to max the 7 major Velious factions, it's impossible to improve Thurgadin factions without hurting Kael Drakkel factions, and impossible to max Kael Drakkel factions without hurting Skyshrine factions. However, the inverse is not true, so the list will tell you to max Dain and Coldain first, then Tormax, Kromzek, and Kromrif (by killing dragons, not dwarves), then finally raise Yelinak and Claws of Veeshan by fighting in Crystallos.</p>
  	<p><strong>Recommended ways to increase faction</strong></p>
  	<p>Some factions can be increased in a variety of ways. For factions that can be increased the faction list and faction info pages will include a recommended way to improve that faction. These recommendations aren't necessarily the fastest or easiest way to increase this faction, but are the way that should have the least negative impact on other factions or will mostly impact factions that can be easily repaired.</p>
  	<h2>Terminology</h2>
  	<p>A few different terms are used throughout this site, the meanings of which are explained below.</p>
  	<h3>Faction Importance</h3>
  	<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
  	<p>Important factions are quest, guard, or merchant factions or any other factions with some benefit associated with increasing them.</p>
  	<p><strong>Unimportant</strong></p>
  	<p>Unimportant factions are factions which can be increased but have no benefit associated with raising them aside from possibly being non-KOS in an area where mobs are normally hostile.</p>
  	<p><strong>Expendable</strong></p>
  	<p>Expendable factions are factions which start KOS and either can't be raised or can never be raised past scowling (such as the various Omens of War hostile factions). These factions can be safely ignored when planning your faction dance.</p>
  	<h3>Faction Relationships</h3>
  	<p>An NPC can only belong to one faction, but killing an NPC or turning in a quest often results in many hits due to the complex relationships between factions.</p>
  	<p><strong>Allies/Enemies</strong></p>
  	<p>Allied factions are those that give sympathetic hits. For example, if you do a quest for one faction you will also gain standing (often a smaller amount) with its allies. Likewise you will lose a bit with a faction's allies for killing one of its members. Faction enemies are naturally the opposite; completing a quest for a faction will make its enemies like you less, while killing NPCs belonging to a faction will make enemies like you more.</p>
  	<p><strong>Ally of/Enemy of</strong></p>
  	<p>These faction relationships are not always bidirectional. For example, nearly every faction in Qeynos and the surrounding zones will give you some sort of hit with Guards of Qeynos, while killing or questing for Guards of Qeynos only yields secondary hits for 4 other factions. Faction A may view Faction B as an ally while Faction B has no view on Faction A.</p>
